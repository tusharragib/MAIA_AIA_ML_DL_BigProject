# MAIA_AIA_ML_DL_BigProject

This repository contains a multi-disciplinary project of Advanced Image Analysis (AIA), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) courses, titled as "Retinal Lesion Segmentation Using Conventional Hand-crafted Image Processing, Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms." from the second semester of the Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree in Medical Imaging and Applications at the University of Cassino and Southern Lazio in Italy.

My colleagues Mr. Santiago Pires, Mr. Syed Nouman Hasany, Ms. Marya Ryspayeva and I accomplished this project as a group activity.
