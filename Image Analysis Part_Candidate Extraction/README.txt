Candidate extraction:
- functions.py: library implemented by us, to simplify the coding
- Candidates extraction MA-HE and EX-SE.py: code use for comparing with ground truth
- Candidates extraction MA-HE and EX-SE with GRD TH.py: code use for comparing with ground truth. It is independent from the one above.
 
The presentation folder explains in detail every step that we follow, with the images that are generated by the codes.

Results of candidates extraction for all images can be found in:
